Classes or known as object oriented programming
Classes represent real world objects
When writing a class you define said object and make its behavior 

When creating a class, you use code like this:
class Object():               #Notice the object we are describing is capitalized
    def __init__(self, desciptive_element):              # two underscores for intitialization
        self.descriptve_element = descriptive_element   
    
    def function(self)         #functions for the class object to inherit

Instances are made to inherit the class functions
ex. my_dog = Dog('Willie', 6)

Attributes are the parameters we give an instance, to access these attribute we use dot notation
ex. my_dog.name

We use classes to call methods which are the defined functions in a class
ex. my_dog.roll_over()

You can make as many instances you want

It is possible to make attributes within the code that are set
To change the value of this attribute you will need to write some code
ex. my_new_car.odometer_reading = 23
it is also possible to do this by calling a method

With classes it is possible to make a child class
to do this you want to make a new class but add the parent class in the parameter
then you want to initialize and add super(). to make a connection
ex. class ElectricCar(Car):
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        super().__init__(make, model, year)
this allows the child class to access methods in the parent class and create some of its own

You can override any parent method by making a method with the same name in the child class
you can make as many classes as you want and call them all to one main class 
ex.
class Electric_car(car):

class Battery():

my_testla.battery.describe_battery()

Importing classes is a great way to call code from somewhere lese and keep organized 
ex. import random

it is reccomended that you be specific when programming se here is a good example
ex. from car import ElectricCar # car is the py document and electric_car the class

It is possible to import multiple classes from one module
ex. from car import Car, ElectricCar # you do this with the comma
